## Recommended Implementation Order

**Phase 1 (MVP)**: Complete Priority 1 items - these provide the foundation for most ML tasks and will make your package immediately useful.

**Phase 2 (Growth)**: Add Priority 2 algorithms - these significantly expand capabilities while building on the foundation.

**Phase 3 (Specialization)**: Implement Priority 3 based on user feedback and specific use cases.

**Phase 4 (Advanced)**: Neural networks require significant complexity - consider if simpler alternatives or integration with existing libraries (like TensorFlow.js) might be better.

**Phase 5 (Polish)**: Advanced features and optimizations to make the package production-ready.

## Notes
- Focus on algorithms that perform well in browser environments
- Consider memory constraints and computation limits
- Prioritize algorithms with broad applicability
- Ensure good performance with moderate dataset sizes (< 10k samples typically)
