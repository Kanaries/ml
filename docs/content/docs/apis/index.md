# @kanaries/ml API Reference

This catalog describes every module available in @kanaries/ml so you can quickly locate the algorithm or utility that fits your JavaScript or TypeScript project. Each section below links to a detailed page covering parameters, usage patterns, and practical tips.

- **[Clusters](clusters/index.md)** – Implement k-means, DBSCAN, spectral clustering, and other unsupervised techniques for segmentation and feature discovery.
- **[Decomposition](decomposition/index.md)** – Run dimensionality reduction methods such as PCA and SVD directly in the browser or Node.js.
- **[Ensemble](ensemble/index.md)** – Combine multiple estimators including Isolation Forest and AdaBoost for robust anomaly detection and boosting workflows.
- **[Linear](linear/index.md)** – Access regression and classification algorithms like Linear Regression, Lasso, and Logistic Regression with sklearn-like APIs.
- **[Manifold](manifold/index.md)** – Visualize high-dimensional data using t-SNE, Isomap, and related manifold learning approaches.
- **[Neighbors](neighbors/index.md)** – Use k-nearest neighbors for search, recommendation, and classification tasks.
- **[SVM](svm/index.md)** – Train support vector machines for high-margin classification and regression scenarios.
- **[Tree](tree/index.md)** – Build decision trees and random forests for interpretable models and tabular data analysis.
- **[Bayes](bayes/index.md)** – Apply naive Bayes and probabilistic models to text classification, spam detection, and more.
- **[NeuralNetwork](neural_network/index.md)** – Prototype lightweight neural networks tailored for in-browser inference.
- **[Utils](utils/index.md)** – Leverage preprocessing helpers, metrics, and shared utilities to streamline your ML pipelines.
- **[SemiSupervised](semi_supervised/index.md)** – Combine labeled and unlabeled data to boost performance in low-label environments.
