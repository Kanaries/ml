# Documentation SEO Optimization Plan

## Objectives
- Improve visibility of the ml documentation for machine learning in JavaScript and TypeScript searches.
- Increase engagement metrics by providing deeper explanations, examples, and internal navigation.
- Ensure each documentation page exposes descriptive meta titles and summaries that highlight key capabilities.

## Target Keywords
- "JavaScript machine learning library"
- "TypeScript machine learning API"
- "browser-based machine learning"
- "JavaScript data science toolkit"
- "@kanaries/ml documentation"
- "isolation forest JavaScript"
- "JavaScript anomaly detection"
- "train machine learning model in the browser"

## Priority Pages
1. **Documentation Home (`docs/content/docs/index.mdx`)**
   - Restructure the hero, value proposition, and navigation to surface primary learning paths.
   - Add scannable feature highlights, quick start workflow, and links to popular guides for stronger engagement.
   - Update metadata and headings with primary keywords such as "JavaScript machine learning" and "browser ML tutorials".
2. **Getting Started (`docs/content/docs/getting-started.mdx` when introduced)**
   - Spin off detailed onboarding steps from the home page into a dedicated guide to support deeper keyword targeting.
   - Include end-to-end workflow examples, troubleshooting tips, and links to API modules.
3. **API References (`docs/content/docs/apis/index.md`)**
   - Provide overview of available modules with keyword-rich descriptions.
   - Introduce internal links and context for each algorithm group.
   - Update meta title/description to emphasize JavaScript/TypeScript ML APIs.
4. **Ensemble Module (`docs/content/docs/apis/ensemble/index.md`)**
   - Replace terse references with explanations of each estimator, expected use cases, and configuration notes.
   - Optimize headers for long-tail queries (e.g., "Isolation Forest anomaly detection in JavaScript").

## Execution Steps
1. **Audit Content** – Review existing structure and identify missing details for priority pages.
2. **Enhance Metadata** – Rewrite titles and descriptions to include high-value keywords.
3. **Expand Content** – Add explanatory text, bullet lists, tables, and cross-links to deepen engagement.
4. **Refactor Navigation** – Consolidate duplicate content, promote popular entry points, and ensure the homepage funnels visitors to top tasks.
5. **Review Internal Linking** – Ensure related docs are linked to encourage navigation across the site.
6. **Quality Check** – Run documentation build/tests (if applicable) and proofread for clarity.

## Success Metrics
- Increased organic impressions for targeted keywords (tracked via analytics tools).
- Longer average session duration on documentation pages.
- Higher click-through rates from search results due to compelling meta information.
